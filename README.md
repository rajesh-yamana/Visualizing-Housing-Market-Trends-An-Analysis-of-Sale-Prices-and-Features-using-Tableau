# 🏡 Visualizing Housing Market Trends: An Analysis of Sale Prices and Features Using Tableau

This project, built for ABC Company, focuses on uncovering patterns in housing sales and renovation trends by leveraging Tableau dashboards and analytical storytelling. With a structured approach and a cleaned dataset of over 21,000 housing records, we dive deep into what influences house prices and how certain property characteristics evolve over time.

## 📊 Project Overview

The housing market is influenced by multiple factors — renovations, structural features, house age, and market dynamics. Our objective was to bring clarity to these elements through data visualizations, enabling ABC Company's decision-makers to:

- Identify how recent renovations affect property sale prices.
- Understand distribution of house age by structural attributes like bathrooms, bedrooms, and floors.
- Measure total sales performance across renovation timelines.
- Compare renovated vs. non-renovated homes based on age groups.

To achieve this, we cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python and then built:

- 4 focused Tableau plots
- 3 interactive and dynamic dashboards
- 1 end-to-end story presentation for business users

We also applied a pivoting technique to unify house attributes for clearer visual comparison. This allowed us to show how bathroom/floor/bedroom counts vary by renovation timing.
